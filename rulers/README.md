## rulers and sticks

The "human stick" is 30 feet long (6 inches / squares) and corresponds to the "speed" of a human, an elf, or a goblin. It has a "hnd axe" indication at 20ft to indicate the normal range of a thrown hand axe or a throw light hammer.

the "eight stick" is a 40 feet long (8 inches / squares) and corresponds to the speed of a wolf or a dog. It's also half the normal range of a shortbow (80ft 16sq). With 2 eight sticks, one can determine the range of a short bow.

The "six stick" is 30 feet long (6 inches / squares). It's similar to the human stick, but has squares count instead of "human" and "hand axe".

Reminder, the longbow normal range is 150ft (30 squares)...
